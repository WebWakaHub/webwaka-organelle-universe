# ORG-CM-COMPOSITION_MODELER-v0.1.0 — P2-T02: Verify Design Consistency

## Design Consistency Matrix
| Check | Criterion | Result |
|-------|-----------|--------|
| DC-01 | State machine covers all specified states (4) | PASS |
| DC-02 | All transitions have defined guards | PASS |
| DC-03 | Primary ports cover all input commands | PASS |
| DC-04 | Secondary ports follow hexagonal architecture | PASS |
| DC-05 | Dependency resolution algorithm specified (Kahn's) | PASS |
| DC-06 | Port compatibility checking defined | PASS |
| DC-07 | No orphan states in FSM | PASS |
| DC-08 | Terminal state (ARCHIVED) is reachable from all non-terminal states | PASS |
| DC-09 | Interface contracts match type definitions | PASS |

**Result: 9/9 PASS — Design is consistent.**
