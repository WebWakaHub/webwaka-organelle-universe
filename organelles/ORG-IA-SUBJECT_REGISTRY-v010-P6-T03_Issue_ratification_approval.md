## Ratification Basis

This ratification approval is issued on the basis of:

1. **P6-T01 Phase Review** (`ORG-IA-SUBJECT_REGISTRY-v010-P6-T01_Review_all_phase_deliverables.md`) — All 6 phases reviewed; ALL received FULL PASS (conditional passes upgraded after real implementation). Overall result: **UNCONDITIONALLY ELIGIBLE FOR RATIFICATION**.

2. **P6-T02 Constitutional Audit** (`ORG-IA-SUBJECT_REGISTRY-v010-P6-T02_Perform_final_constitutional_audit.md`) — All 8 constitutional articles audited; zero violations found. Overall result: **FULLY COMPLIANT**.

## Ratification Decision

**RATIFICATION APPROVED**

The Subject Registry Organelle (`ORG-IA-SUBJECT_REGISTRY-v0.1.0`) is hereby ratified as a canonical WebWaka platform organelle.

### Ratification Scope

This ratification covers:

- The **specification** (`SUBJECT_REGISTRY_ORGANELLE.md` v0.1.0) as the authoritative definition of the organelle's purpose, responsibilities, invariants, and boundaries
- The **design** (`SUBJECT_REGISTRY_ORGANELLE_DESIGN.md` v0.1.0) as the authoritative structural blueprint
- The **internal validation** (`SUBJECT_REGISTRY_ORGANELLE_VALIDATION.md` v0.1.0) as the authoritative invariant stress-test record

### What This Ratification Grants

1. **Canonical Status:** `ORG-IA-SUBJECT_REGISTRY-v0.1.0` is now a ratified canonical organelle. All higher-layer structures (Cells, Tissues, Organs, Systems) may reference and depend upon this organelle.

2. **Immutability of Core Invariants:** The 7 invariants declared in the specification are now constitutionally locked. Any change to these invariants requires a new MAJOR version (`v1.0.0`) and a new ratification cycle.

3. **Dependency Eligibility:** Cell-layer structures in the Identity & Access category may declare a dependency on this organelle without requiring additional approval.

4. **Implementation Authority:** webwakaagent4 (the assigned implementation agent) is authorised to proceed with code-level implementation of this organelle within Cell-layer instantiation contexts, using this specification as the binding contract.

### Conditions Attached to Ratification

1. ~~**Code Implementation Deferred:**~~ **SUPERSEDED** — Real TypeScript implementation committed to `webwaka-organelle-subject-registry` with enhanced types, state machine, storage interfaces, and observability hooks.

2. **Version Lock:** This ratification applies to `v0.1.0` only. Any backward-incompatible change requires a new version (`v1.0.0`) and a full 7-phase cycle.

3. **Audit Trail Requirement:** All instantiations of this organelle in Cell or higher-layer contexts must reference this ratification record (`ORG-IA-SUBJECT_REGISTRY-v010-P6-T03`) in their implementation artefacts.
