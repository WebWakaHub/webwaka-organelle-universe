## I. Ratification Declaration

This document provides the formal, deterministic, and constitutionally ratified definition of the 18 Organelle Categories that form the primitive layer of the WebWaka Biological Architecture. These categories are immutable and may not be renamed, merged, or otherwise altered without a formal constitutional amendment as defined in the `BIOLOGICAL_GOVERNANCE_CONSTITUTION.md`.

## III. Structural Invariants

- No Organelle may exist outside of these 18 ratified categories.
- Each Organelle belongs to exactly one category.
- Categories cannot be merged or renamed without a formal constitutional amendment.
- Categories are technology-agnostic.
- Categories are industry-agnostic.
- Categories are future-proof.

---

## IV. Exhaustiveness Assertion

These 18 categories are declared sufficient to model the primitive behaviors of:

- Enterprise systems
- Government systems
- Financial systems
- AI-native systems
- Industrial systems
- Planetary-scale systems
- Hypothetical off-world systems

No new physics are required to model any known or conceivable digital system at the primitive layer.

## V. Amendment Rule

Any change to this universe of 18 categories requires a formal constitutional amendment, to be proposed and ratified through the `webwaka-governance` repository.
